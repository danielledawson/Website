<h1>Grandmothers Creations</h1>
<body>
  <p>My nan learned how to make these traditional medicines from our aunty Wata and my great gran Ethel and gramps Jimmy. She learned to pick only what she needs. She goes out in the forests picks out stinging nettle, devils club, horsetail, twin berry alder, plantain, and spruce pitch. She then drys them out or puts them in olive oil for ten days, then simmers on the stove in a bath water for two days.</p>
