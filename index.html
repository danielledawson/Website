  <p>My nan learned how to make these traditional medicines in her 20's from my great gran Ethel. She learned more later on from our aunty Wata. Before she goes to gather she says a prayer. <em>She learned to take only what she needs.</em> She only goes to gather where its safe to do so. My gran goes out in the forests picks out stinging nettle, devils club, horsetail, twin berry alder, plantain, and spruce pitch. She says a prayer of thanks after she gathers what she needs. She then drys them out or puts them in olive oil for ten days, then simmers on the stove in a bath water for two days. She says another prayer before putting them in jars. "Our natural medicines are more powerful and better than pharmacy, and its known to work! People have thanked me many times saying they used prescriptions by doctors and it didnt work, mine has." my nan says.</p>

<p>My nan has been loom beading since she was ten years old. She learned beading from gramps for something to do long winter nights. She started loom beading again when my uncle Wa announced that he'll be having a potlatch soon. She started beading to make gifts for the potlatch. He sends her designs and she beads them, then glues the designs on hats, caps, toques etc. She just recently started making lanyards and keychains because I asked her when she started if she can make me a black and yellow lanyard. </p>
